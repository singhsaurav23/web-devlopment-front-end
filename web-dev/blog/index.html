     <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
     <p class="quote">“The future is ours to shape. I feel we are in a race that we need to win. It’s a race between the growing power of the technology and the growing wisdom we need to manage it.” ~Max Tegmark</p>
    <p>Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across. As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer that which makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn. Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would expect.</p>

      The term Machine Learning was coined by Arthur Samuel in 1959, an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence and stated that “it gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”.And in 1997, Tom Mitchell gave a “well-posed” mathematical and relational definition that “A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

      <h2>Classification of ML</h2>
      <p class="quote">“Just as electricity transformed almost everything 100 years ago, today I actually have a hard time thinking of an industry that I don’t think AI (Artificial Intelligence) will transform in the next several years.” ~Andrew Ng</p>

      <h3>Supervised learning:</h3> The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a “teacher”, and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. The training process continues until the model achieves the desired level of accuracy on the training data. Some real-life examples are:
      <h6><li>Image Classification:</li></h6> You train with images/labels. Then in the future you give a new image expecting that the computer will recognize the new object.
      <h6><li>Market Prediction/Regression:</li></h6> You train the computer with historical market data and ask the computer to predict the new price in the future.
      <h3>Unsupervised learning:</h3> No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. It is used for clustering population in different groups. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data).
      <h6><li>Clustering:</li></h6> You ask the computer to separate similar data into clusters, this is essential in research and science.
      <h6><li>High Dimension Visualization:</li></h6> Use the computer to help us visualize high dimension data.
      <h6><li>Generative Models:</li></h6> After a model captures the probability distribution of your input data, it will be able to generate more data. This can be very useful to make your classifier more robust.
